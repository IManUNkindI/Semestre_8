 issuing CNCHECK,AUTO command for this problem in order to achieve       
 better convergence.

 The Sparse Matrix solver is currently running in the in-core memory     
 mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to      
 avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most often        
 results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if      
 enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver
